Title:
Detecting Fraud With Oversampling Techniques and Sparsity Contraints

Abstract:
Fraud detection is prevalent now more than ever due to the massive surge
in the usage of online platforms. Many techniques exist to combat fraud;
however, they often fail to capture the imbalanced class structure in data in-
volving fraudulent activities. Itâ€™s important to tackle such concern so we can
harness its power to correctly predict anomalies. So, the question remains:
How can we effectively detect and mitigate fraudulent activities, especially
when faced with imbalanced datasets? Our research contributes to the study
of such concern with a model that harnesses the strengths of many existing
techniques from different domains. We propose a solution that utilizes a com-
bination of oversampling techniques and sparsity constraints to balance and
predict fraud data.
